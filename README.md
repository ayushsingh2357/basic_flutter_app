# myapp
This folder contains two apps
Basic app for learning the basics of flutter where I show the information of Virat Kholi

I have learnt several things by making this app like the centre property, padding property, scaffold, stateless and stateful widget, importing file from different directory, how to use images in the app, editing pubspec.yaml file and adding dependencies.          

Second app is a quiz game app which include two screens:
A welcome screen and a quiz game screen where I have learnt several things like how to put in parameters, how to use listview builder, image as a background, use gesturecontrol, etc.

If you want to run the basic app then in main.dart just uncomment the first part, comment the second part of runApp and if you want
to run the second app then comment the first part and uncomment the second part
